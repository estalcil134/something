      <h1>Wilson T. Wong</h1>
      <p>I am a freshman at RPI with a dual major of Computer Science and ITWS. I enjoy playing ping pong, Pokemon, League of Legends, and various other games, reading, and generally spending time with my friends. I also enjoy making things, including tools, toys, and small sculptures(although my "art" is hardly passable). I also have a very powerful imagination which I use to solve problems. </p>
